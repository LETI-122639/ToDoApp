## Project Structure

The sources of your Todoapp have the following structure:

```
src
├── main/frontend
│   └── themes
│       └── default
│           ├── styles.css
│           └── theme.json
├── main/java
│   └── [application package]
│       ├── base
│       │   └── ui
│       │       ├── component
│       │       │   └── ViewToolbar.java
│       │       ├── MainErrorHandler.java
│       │       └── MainLayout.java
│       ├── examplefeature
│       │   ├── ui
│       │   │   └── TaskListView.java
│       │   ├── Task.java
│       │   ├── TaskRepository.java
│       │   └── TaskService.java                
│       └── Application.java       
└── test/java
    └── [application package]
        └── examplefeature
           └── TaskServiceTest.java                 
```
### ⚙️ CI/CD Automation — GitHub Actions

This feature introduces an automated **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** process for the TodoApp project, developed following Scrum best practices.  
The main goal is to automatically build and publish a runnable `.jar` file whenever new code is pushed to the main branch.

---

### 🧾 Feature Overview
As part of our continuous improvement process, the team implemented a **GitHub Actions workflow** that automates the build phase of the project.  
This ensures that the application can be compiled, packaged, and distributed consistently outside the development environment.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The workflow runs automatically on every **push to the `main` branch**.  
- The pipeline **sets up a Java 21 environment** using the official GitHub Action.  
- Executes the command **`mvn clean package`** to build the `.jar` file.  
- The resulting `.jar` file is **published as a downloadable artifact** in the GitHub Actions tab.  
- (Optional) The JAR is **copied to the root of the repository** for easy access in the web interface.  
- Build logs and artifacts are available under the **Actions** section in the repository.

---

### 🧩 Implementation Details

The workflow is defined in the file:

📂 `.github/workflows/build.yml`

The main entry point into the application is `Application.java`. This class contains the `main()` method that start up 
the Spring Boot application.

The skeleton follows a *feature-based package structure*, organizing code by *functional units* rather than traditional 
architectural layers. It includes two feature packages: `base` and `examplefeature`.

* The `base` package contains classes meant for reuse across different features, either through composition or 
  inheritance. You can use them as-is, tweak them to your needs, or remove them.
* The `examplefeature` package is an example feature package that demonstrates the structure. It represents a 
  *self-contained unit of functionality*, including UI components, business logic, data access, and an integration test.
  Once you create your own features, *you'll remove this package*.

The `src/main/frontend` directory contains an empty theme called `default`, based on the Lumo theme. It is activated in
the `Application` class, using the `@Theme` annotation.

## Starting in Development Mode

To start the application in development mode, import it into your IDE and run the `Application` class. 
You can also start the application from the command line by running: 

```bash
./mvnw
```

## Building for Production

To build the application in production mode, run:

```bash
./mvnw -Pproduction package
```

To build a Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:latest .
```

If you use commercial components, pass the license key as a build secret:

```bash
docker build --secret id=proKey,src=$HOME/.vaadin/proKey .
```

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started) guide will quickly familiarize you with your new
Todoapp implementation. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, understand the project 
structure, and find resources to help you add muscles to your skeleton — transforming it into a fully-featured 
application.
